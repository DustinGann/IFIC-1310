  <h1>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h1>
<p>  Web acessablity is a very intesting subject. On the one hand its really nice to help out those who have hard times navagateing the internet, but on the other hand it seems tedous and anoying to set all of that up let alone learn it. Some changes seem much simpaler than others to implament. Alot of the changes can be made simply by wrighting your code a bit diffrently. like wriggting it in the html inted of css, so I dont know how much work total would be required to make your work more acessable. 
 </p><p>there are many diffrent resons that accesablity is important. this is because there are many diffrent ways people can be impared. some people arnt able to use a mouse properly. some people cane se very well. both of these can be mitagated by designing you websight to be acessable. for example when creating a websight foe people with motor imparements, you can design with the tab button im mind. if done properly this will allow the usser to navagate without a mose at all.
