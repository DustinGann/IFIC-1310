  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
<p>  Web acessablity is a very intesting subject. On the one hand its really nice to help out those who have hard times navagateing the internet, but on the other hand it seems tedous and anoying to set all of that up let alone learn it. Some changes seem much simpaler than others to implament. Alot of the changes can be made simply by wrighting your code a bit diffrently. like wriggting it in the html inted of css, so I dont know how much work total would be required to make your work more acessable. 
 </p>
 <p>there are many diffrent resons that accesablity is important. this is because there are many diffrent ways people can be impared. some people arnt able to use a mouse properly. some people cane se very well. both of these can be mitagated by designing you websight to be acessable. for example when creating a websight foe people with motor imparements, you can design with the tab button im mind. if done properly this will allow the usser to navagate without a mose at all.

 <h2>Graceful Degeneration and Progressive Enhancement</h2>
 
<p>Graceful degradation seems to be a mindset where the programmer focuses on making a website optimized for the biggest baddest browsers and just keeping it functional on any subpar browsers. Progressive enhancement is where you instead focus on making sure your content is as accessible and digestible as possible. Progressive enhancement is the better way of going about things because ultimately, the content is the whole point of why you build a website. If someone can't comfortably access your content they will just move on. So you have to create a website that is usable even if some of the code isn't compatible or working. If this is done it will be more available for more people to access.
